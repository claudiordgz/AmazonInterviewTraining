    Three in one
    Describe how you could use a single array to implement
    three stacks
    A stack is a LIFO data structure that supports the following:

    - pop() - remove and return top of stack
    - push(item) - add item to top of stack
    - peek() - return top of stack without removing
    - isEmpty() - True if no elements
